### About

I'm a German-American software developer and I made this website to share my work. I'm very interested in procedural design and simulation of natural and social systems.

I've always had a passion for designing games and storytelling, which has driven me to pursue programming. Game Jams are always a big draw for me and I'm eager to get busy on whatever my latest personal project is.
