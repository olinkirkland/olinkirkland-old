### About

I'm a German-American software developer and I made this website to share my work. My projects are mainly developed in Adobe Air, and my current personal project, Realms, is no different. I'm very interested in procedural design and simulation of natural and social systems.

As a programmer at both the Museum of Natural Science in Houston and as a freelancer I've taken on leadership roles in software projects and worked closely with researchers, graphic designers, and animators on tight schedules.

I've freelanced in Edinburgh and Berlin, worked as teacher in Washington D.C., and built learning applications as the lead programmer for an exhibit design company in Houston. Since then, I've moved to Regensburg to program security software at Dallmeier Electronic GmbH & Co. KG.

### Game Development

I've always had a passion for designing games and storytelling, which drove me to pursue programming an early age. Game Jams are always a big draw for me and I'm eager to get busy on whatever my latest personal project is.

### Interactive Work

In 2015, I moved to Texas to join the team at Paul Bernhard Exhibits and was tasked with developing applications for the brand new Wiess Energy Hall in the Houston Museum of Natural Science. The 30,000 square foot exhibit space contains nearly seventy individual interactive exhibits, many of which run touchscreen driven content I created.

After finishing my work on the Wiess Energy Hall, I began doing side projects for the museum as a freelance developer. I designed and developed multiple applications within the Knights and Armor and Death by Natural Causes exhibitions.
