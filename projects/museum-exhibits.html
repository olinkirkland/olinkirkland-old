		<h2>Museum Exhibits</h2>
		<p>In 2015, I travelled to Texas and took the position of lead programmer at Paul Bernhard Exhibit Design. After developing applications there for the Houston Museum of Natural Science's Energy Hall, I also worked on other exhibits at the museum.</p>
                    <a class="anchor" id="death-by-natural-causes"></a>
                    <div class="project-container">
                        <img class="centered-and-cropped" width="100%" height="200" src="/images/demo.jpg"/>
                        <div class="centered"><h2><span>Death&nbsp;by&nbsp;Natural&nbsp;Causes</span></h2></div>
                    </div>
                    <p><i>"The things you fear are the least of your worries! Death by Natural Causes will introduce patrons to the range of 'animal, vegetable, and mineral' dangers that lurk in their everyday lives."</i> -&nbsp;<a href="https://houmuse.org/explore/events/death-by-natural-causes/">Death by Natural Causes</a></p>
                    <h1>Death Predictor</h1>
                    <p>The Death Predictor Exhibit is an intuitive quiz application that allows users to view how their
                        own life choices affect their lifespan.</p>
                    <h1>Snakebite!</h1>
                    <p>The Snakebite exhibit consists of an interactive kiosk to allow visitors to visualise how a
                        snakebite would take effect on their limbs.</p>

                    <a class="anchor" id="energy-hall"></a>

                        <div class="centered"><h2><span>Energy&nbsp;Hall</span></h2></div>
                    </div>
                    <p><i>"Joining the completely redesigned “classic” displays is a bonanza of entirely new exhibits, making the new hall the most contemporary, comprehensive and technologically advanced exhibition on the science and technology of energy anywhere in the world."</i> -&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hmns.org/exhibits/permanent-exhibitions/energy-hall/">Wiess Energy Hall</a></p>
                    <h1>Energy Career Quiz</h1>
                    <p>The Energy Career Quiz application places users into one of a dozen energy-related careers after
                        they take a short quiz of ten questions. A plucky, animated robot follows the museum-goer's
                        choices throughout and models a career-related outfit at the end.</p>
                    <h1>Renewable Energy</h1>
                    <p>In the middle of the Renewable Exhibit sits the Hub application, whirring with colorful particle
                        effects and a beautiful gallery of images from the Land Art Generator Initiative. Around it are
                        placed a set of eight interactive touch screen kiosks with content related to the production of
                        energy from various renewable sources.</p>
                    <h1>Geosteering Game</h1>
                    <p>This game shows a side-view representation of the practice of geosteering for oil
                        exploration.</p>
                    <h1>Traps and Plays Interactive Projection</h1>
                    <p>This application displays 3D animated videos on a fabricated rock wall that simulate depth and
                        real motion.</p>
                    <h1>Prospector Slot Machine</h1>
                    <p>This slot machine game has a physical lever users can pull to try and win. Educational text
                        panels educate visitors about the history of oil prospecting.</p>
                    <h1>Frack It</h1>
                    <p>The "Can You Frack It" interactive game describes the practice of fracturing the ground for
                        natural gas – or “fracking” as it’s known in the industry. Basically, put poisonous sludge in
                        the ground, suck out the oil.</p>
                    <h1>Geologic Timeline</h1>
                    <p>The Geologic Timeline application is a fun and educational experience for any age, boasting
                        brightly animated scenes from each time period.</p>
                    <h1>Continental Drift Timeline</h1>
                    <p>The Continental Drift application is a straightforward interactive that allows users to scrub
                        through time and view how tectonic plates have shifted in the past and how they are predicted to
                        shift in the future.</p>
                    <h1>Hydrocarbon Deposits Map</h1>
                    <p>The “Hydrocarbon Information Center” application consists of series of static maps generated from
                        donated Wood Mackenzie data and was developed using custom global plotting code on top of a
                        stylized vector map.</p>
                    <h1>Energy Map</h1>
                    <p>The GIS Energy Map is an informative two screen interactive map that lets users explore energy
                        distribution on the North American continent.</p>
                    <h1>Media Kiosks</h1>
                    <p>I developed a set of nine interactive dual-screen touch screen kiosks with content related to
                        unconventional energy production, two related to seismic surveys, and four related to oil and
                        gas pipelines.</p>
                    <h1>Future Energy Kiosks</h1>
                    <p>The Future Energy Kiosks section in the Future Energy Exhibit of the Wiess Energy Hall consists
                        of a set of interactive touch screen kiosks with content related to the future of energy
                        production, trade, and consumption. I developed these later in the project and revamped the
                        video player to run more smoothly and with better playback control.</p>
                    <h1>Exhibit Support Tools</h1>
                    <p>While working on the Wiess Energy Hall, I realized quickly that there were some unfulfilled needs
                        for the development crew and floor staff, so I worked with them to create solutions to their
                        specific problems.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p><i>"Chivalry and duty are bound together by the masterpieces of European arms and armors, dating from the Medieval and Renaissance ages to the romanticized 'Medieval' of the 1800’s"</i> -&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hmns.org/exhibits/past-exhibitions/knights/">Knights and Armor</a></p>
                    <h1>Crest Creator</h1>
                    <p>Using the Crest Creator, museum-goers make their own crest by picking from a wide selection of
                        colors, materials, and decorative prints, then Email it to themselves.</p>
                    <h1>Digital Armor Encyclopedia</h1>
                    <p>The Digital Armor Encyclopedia is an application developed to educate visitors at the Houston
                        Museum of Natural Science about types of medieval armor and the years during which those types
                        were used.</p>
                    <h1>Feudal Careers</h1>
                    <p>This career quiz places users at random into careers that they might have had in the European
                        Middle Ages. The random chance is roughly representative of what professions were most common in
                        the time period, and there is no connection between answers chosen by users and the resulting
                        profession as a commentary on medieval life and the rigid hereditary structure of the feudal
                        system.</p>
                    <h1>Castle Map</h1>
                    <p>I collaborated with the Houston Museum of Natural Science‘s Exhibit Architect Kevin Gold and
                        Curator of Anthropology Dirk Van Tuerenhout to create an enormous map of European castles.</p>
                    <p>To allow the volunteer researchers working on the Castle Map to submit their data, I set up a
                        system that helped them submit their researched data entries from home.</p>
