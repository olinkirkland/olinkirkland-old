City generation within this world was also a goal, and I did some research into it. The best resource for city generation (somewhat recently kind of integrated with Azgaar’s work, more of an easter egg really) is by the procedural generation wizard Watabou and covers districts, walls, farms, roads, and rivers.

Most of these programmers overlap in some way and borrow ideas from each other, and each has their own way of explaining certain concepts they've worked on making all of them crucial for a complete understanding of map generation.</p>\n<p>Azgaar has the best (bar none) available map generator that can be run immediately in the browser. His work is current but unfortunately I find it hard to understand a lot of his (JavaScript) code.

His blog doesn’t usually show actual code, but goes into a satisfying amount of detail about how he achieves his map generation. He mainly focuses on generated art, creating maps that look practically hand drawn.

A giant \"sticky\" mountain with a few mountains dotted around it. Raise the sea level to produce islands and continents, practically at random. Looks okay, but isn't very realistic. The map ends up with several mountains but no mountain ranges to speak of. Drop moisture on the map evenly and roll it down slopes to produce rivers.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/21/rundll32_2020-09-22_11-43-31.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/21/responsive/rundll32_2020-09-22_11-43-31-xs.png 300w ,https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/21/responsive/rundll32_2020-09-22_11-43-31-sm.png 480w ,https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/21/responsive/rundll32_2020-09-22_11-43-31-md.png 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1332\" height=\"941\">\n<figcaption >Simple enough, the first iteration of the voronoi-cell map generator looks good.

German on the other hand simply combines common words or names into place names.</p>\n<p>I put together a pretty convoluted system for naming places after trying multiple other approaches including real place names and <a href=\"https://www.samcodes.co.uk/project/markov-namegen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">markov chains</a>. These methods, while fast and easy to implement resulted in irrelevant names. For example, an inland town with an industry focused around a salt mine should probably be called something related to that. Or related to the founder of the town. Random real place names and markov chains ignore context entirely.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/21/gallery/adl_2019-04-27_22-15-13.png\" data-size=\"1920x974\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/21/gallery/adl_2019-04-27_22-15-13-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"390\"></a>\n<figcaption>Region names</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/21/gallery/adl_2019-07-30_18-56-43.png\" data-size=\"940x882\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/21/gallery/adl_2019-07-30_18-56-43-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"721\"></a>\n<figcaption>Town names</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>I learned a ton from this project, but I started running into performance issues and got demotivated by technical debt as my code base grew.</p>\n<p>You can view my <a href=\"https://github.com/olinkirkland/realms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">source code</a> on GitHub or view the (inactive) <a href=\"https://trello.com/b/SoUEo0DZ/realms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trello board</a>.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>I usually just hardcode the text on buttons, menus, and text fields. This is fast and for most of my purposes definitely good enough, but makes any app really hard to translate into different languages.</p>\n<p>In my professional career as a software developer, I've come across a couple different methods of implementing localization and wanted to try implementing a simple form of it for my Worldmaker app. I decided on three objectives.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Accessing strings needs to be simple. <code>LanguageManager.getText(\"foo\", [], 0, false)</code> is ugly and confusing. Much easier: <code>Local.text(\"foo\")</code></li>\n<li>It has to be in JSON. No XML, no custom arrangement, just simple JSON that can be parsed in. I also happen to know the popular localization web platform <a href=\"https://poeditor.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">POEditor</a> lets you import JSON which means outsourcing newly added languages would be a breeze.</li>\n<li>Adding new dictionaries and language entries should be straightforward. If I want to localize to a new language, I should be able to easily scale up my dictionaries to meet that need.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>First, I created a class called <code>Local.as</code> which stores all the logic needed for the dictionaries and language-related string manipulation.</p>\n<p>Let's break down what the class does. <code>Local.as</code> contains references to the JSON dictionaries, a property to keep track of the selected language, and the current dictionary of keys and terms.</p>\n<p>Apart from that, a function <code>set language(id:String)</code> sets the selected language and loads the appropriate dictionary, while the static function <code>get text(id:String, args:Array = null):String</code> allows other classes to easily access the current dictionary's key entries. If an unknown key is accessed, a trace lets me know exactly what key is missing so I can enter it into the dictionary.</p>\n<p>I implemented a little popup to change the language - finally the options button on the navigation bar has some use! I added pig-latin after a suggestion from a friend for testing purposes; it's easier to produce pig-latin on the fly than German or French and it looks better than lorem ipsum.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/19/adl_2021-07-07_22-32-57.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/19/responsive/adl_2021-07-07_22-32-57-xs.png 300w ,https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/19/responsive/adl_2021-07-07_22-32-57-sm.png 480w ,https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/19/responsive/adl_2021-07-07_22-32-57-md.png 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"487\" height=\"276\">\n<figcaption >The highly awaited options popup</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/19/Untitled.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/19/responsive/Untitled-xs.png 300w ,https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/19/responsive/Untitled-sm.png 480w ,https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/19/responsive/Untitled-md.png 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"882\" height=\"860\">\n<figcaption >Left: English, Right: Pig-latin</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>I'm very happy with how it turned out.

And if the resulting height map isn't at least kind of believable and follows some semblance of natural processes, nothing else will be.</p>\n<p>My approach so far is a little simplistic, but I got to work out some kinks of how the different parts of the app interact with each other during the development, and due to the modular nature of how the app is structured, coming back to this step later on will be very straightforward.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Tectonic plates</em> are pieces of Earth's crust and uppermost mantle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The theory of plate tectonics describes how these bits of crust have drifted around on the planet for the past three billion years, forming mountains when they crash into each other or trenches when they pull apart. Tectonic plates come in a variety of shapes and sizes, with each plate representing pretty distinct regions of the planet's surface.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Plates_tect2_en.svg/1200px-Plates_tect2_en.svg.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"\" width=\"717\" height=\"490\">\n<figcaption >Earth's tectonic plates (Wikipedia)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>If I wanted to really simulate plate tectonics, I'd have to model the different plates, their velocities, direction, the currents of magma beneath the crust, and how the plates change shape when they collide or sink. I don't really care too much (right now) about recreating the science behind plate tectonics, though it would be interesting to model plate movement and flora/fauna evolution over time. But for the purposes of my app, I don't think it's a crucial component.

Instead, I'm just assigning any tectonic plate that touches the border of the map to be a \"deep\" plate. This plate type is unique to the app (and not found in real life); the height map will ignore any border between deep plates. The idea is to get a big, flat ocean around a series of continents in the middle of the map. This way I can wrap around later when it comes to pathfinding, wind, climate, etc.</p>\n<p>Assigning plate types is straightforward: I want some percent of the area to belong to continental plates, so I first sort the plates from smallest to largest, then assign their type to continental one by one until the total area of continental plates exceeds the goal. I haven't decided what that percent should be yet, but I'll play around with it until I'm happy with it.</p>\n<p>It's totally possible for users to create their plates from scratch (well, to place the plate origins and choose the directions/types).</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/18/adl_2021-07-06_15-01-50.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/18/responsive/adl_2021-07-06_15-01-50-xs.png 300w ,https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/18/responsive/adl_2021-07-06_15-01-50-sm.png 480w ,https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/18/responsive/adl_2021-07-06_15-01-50-md.png 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"366\" height=\"336\">\n<figcaption >Editing a tectonic plate in the toolbar's plate list</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>I added a \"Quick Start\" feature that gets prompted from a popup when entering the step to automatically generate plates from the get-go.

Instead of sending events to the Map class, this time the Layers Pane and the Map pane both directly access the layers ArrayCollection that's created and stored in the TaskManager's currentTask.

This was really exciting to put together but the technical debt became too great in the end and I was having a lot of trouble with wind simulation, continent generation, my code structure, and miserable performance. I put down the procedural experimenting for a while.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/13/chrome_2021-03-11_23-21-56.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/13/responsive/chrome_2021-03-11_23-21-56-xs.png 300w ,https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/13/responsive/chrome_2021-03-11_23-21-56-sm.png 480w ,https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/13/responsive/chrome_2021-03-11_23-21-56-md.png 768w\"  alt=\"Realms with forests, cities, and connecting roads\" width=\"2260\" height=\"1461\">\n<figcaption >Realms with forests, cities, and connecting roads</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Then, I decided that realms weren't enough. I wanted to make \"Worlds\". Realms had never felt that big, really - the regions felt kind of small and the islands produced by the generator didn't look or act like real continents. I also had had a lot of trouble with rendering mountains and wanted to do something more '3D'. So I started with Worlds. It felt really good going back to the drawing board and beginning with an eye on performance: I used a quad-tree to keep track of the voronoi cell points so that finding points would be smooth. The different logic layers like wind and hydrology were separated reasonably into different areas of the code instead of being jumbled together. The logic occurred in one place and once it was done, the map was drawn in a single step. In general, Worlds was leaps and bounds ahead of Realms.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/13/adl_2021-03-09_23-23-45.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/13/responsive/adl_2021-03-09_23-23-45-xs.png 300w ,https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/13/responsive/adl_2021-03-09_23-23-45-sm.png 480w ,https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/13/responsive/adl_2021-03-09_23-23-45-md.png 768w\"  alt=\"Worlds with &quot;low-poly&quot; style relief shading\" width=\"1692\" height=\"968\">\n<figcaption >Worlds with \"low-poly\" style relief shading</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>But even so, some of the new features I added felt cumbersome. Settings were organized pretty poorly and wind still didn't work well. I thought the 3D style initially looked really good but the longer I worked with it the more tiresome it grew. I really wanted to make a stylized 2D map and the low-poly shading just wasn't doing that for me. The tectonics system I introduced was good on the surface but only about 10% of the resulting maps looked \"fun\".</p>\n<p>Here comes Worldmaker.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>No longer satisfied with purely procedural maps, I want to make an application that <strong>lets the user define different \"keystone\" decisions</strong> that are hard to generate.</li>\n<li>I want to release the app once it's functional to get feedback - and continue to <strong>release versions with improvements</strong> that enhance or replace the \"keystone\" decisions.</li>\n<li>To do this, I decided to <strong>make a launcher</strong> first. A launcher will let users install different versions of the app and create, load, and share their own world projects.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What are examples of \"keystone\" decisions? In Realms, only one keystone could be set: The map's seed, a number used to determine every random aspect of the map. Worlds introduced a number of settings to fine tune the map, but the map settings weren't stored with the map. Sea level, wind strength, and average temperature are all easily set keystones with a slider but something like tectonic plate design or island chains is not.</p>\n<p>I want this to be a lot closer to what Azgaar does in his map generator, but more step-by-step and intuitive as far as UI goes.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/13/gallery/adl_2021-03-11_23-05-25.png\" data-size=\"480x671\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/13/gallery/adl_2021-03-11_23-05-25-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"671\"></a>\n<figcaption>Creating a new project</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/13/gallery/adl_2021-03-11_23-09-54.png\" data-size=\"1920x1080\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/13/gallery/adl_2021-03-11_23-09-54-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a>\n<figcaption>Managing versions</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/13/gallery/chrome_2021-03-01_13-21-16.png\" data-size=\"984x734\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://olinkirk.land/media/posts/13/gallery/chrome_2021-03-01_13-21-16-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/10090105-Dashboard-UI\" width=\"768\" height=\"573\"></a>\n<figcaption>UI Design Inspiration</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>I've spent several evenings designing and writing the code for the different UI components in the launcher, and the style will carry over into the application itself.</p>",
